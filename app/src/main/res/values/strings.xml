    <string name="MoumentDef">Momentum is a physical quantity that represents the amount of force acting on an object multiplied by the time for which it acts. It is measured in units of kilogram meters per second (kg m/s).</string>
    <string name="momountExample">Sample Example: \"If a motorcycle with a mass of 150 kilograms is traveling at a velocity of 20 meters per second, depands on Law M=150 and v = 20 , so m*v = 150*20 = 3000</string>
